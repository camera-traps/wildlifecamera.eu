**John wants something easy!**

Our project aims to support European, national, regional and stakeholder organisationsâ€™ efforts to conserve and manage biodiversity by enhancing their timely access to robust monitoring data for a wide set of species not currently covered by accessible monitoring data.

More specifically, the objectives are to:

- Address human, technological, and analytical bottlenecks to generate a set of tools that will permit the large-scale and efficient processing, sharing, analysis, and exploitation of CT data on an unprecedented continental scale.
- Link together professional scientists, citizen scientists, and stakeholders in a joint action to
promote efficient conservation and management of biodiversity.
- Produce a European solution that fits the European setting (social, legal, institutional, ecological, technological) with transfer value to other settings beyond Europe.
